# Messaging App Extension Playground ğŸ•¹

The playground app is intended for getting started and experimenting with the key aspects before starting to build production-ready applications.

The app lets you:

- Authorize with Pipedrive and obtain access tokens.
- Generate the provider manifest file dynamically and mock provider endpoints.
- Create messaging channel in Pipedrive and infer the response.
- Integrate with WhatsApp via the Cloud API and Pipedrive Messaging Inbox via the Channel API
- Troubleshoot via debug logs

If you are running this app _locally_, you need to make sure of the following things:
- Fill in the `.env.example` file with required details based on the [tutorial](https://developers.pipedrive.com/tutorials). Make sure you rename it to `.env` before running the app
- Use [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/) to create a tunnel to your app by using the `ngrok http 3000` command. If you change the port, make sure you change the port in the command accordingly.
- Set the value for the environment variable `PROJECT_DOMAIN`. This will be the ngrok domain (For instance : xxx.ngrok.io)
- Use the ngrok generated domain for callback url and in provider endpoints so that it can reach your app over the internet.

> NB! Delete the `sqlite` database that is created in the `data` folder if you are committing to a public repo as it contains information about users.
