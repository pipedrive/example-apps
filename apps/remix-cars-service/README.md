# Car Services Example app

This is an example [Remix](https://remix.run) app that demonstrates and experiments with [Custom UI Extensions](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/custom-ui-extensions) in its three types: Custom panels, Custom modals and Custom UI for app settings.

**NB:** This app should not be used as a production-ready app as OAuth installation and token verification are not covered here. 

## Examples

### Custom Modal

### Custom Panel

### Custom UI Settings

## Run with StackBlitz

This option works well if you want to try out the examples without the need of local development setup or deployment to the cloud servers.

Open [project](https://stackblitz.com/edit/remix-cars-service) in StackBlitz.

Use the generated URL in Marketplace Manager as the iframe URL for Custom UI Extension, i.e. 
- Set `https://remix-cars-service--3000.local.webcontainer.io/list` as the Iframe URL for the Custom Panel
- Set `https://remix-cars-service--3000.local.webcontainer.io/details` as the Iframe URL for the Custom Modal. The name of Custom UI Extension should be set as **Details**, otherwise it won't be opened from Custom Panel with SDK command
- Set `https://remix-cars-service--3000.local.webcontainer.io/settings` as the Iframe URL for the Settings page

### Known issues

There is a limitation with Backend API when running service with StackBlitz: the item proposal update and reset from settings will not work. Please choose [Deploy with Vercel](#deploy-with-vercel) for a full working example.

### Create project

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpipedrive%2Fexample-apps%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Fapps%2Fremix-cars-service)

#### Alternative: use CLI

Clone the repository and switch to the folder with the project. Install `vercel` CLI tool and follow its instructions. 

```sh
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

### Setup application in [Marketplace Manager](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/marketplace-manager)

Use the **generated** project URL in Marketplace Manager for Custom UI Extension, i.e.
- Set `https://remix-cars-service.vercel.app/list` as the Iframe URL for the Custom Panel.
- Set `https://remix-cars-service.vercel.app/details` as the Iframe URL for the Custom Modal. The name of Custom UI Extension should be set as **Details**. Otherwise, it won't be open from the Custom Panel with the SDK command.
- Set `https://remix-cars-service.vercel.app/settings` as the Iframe URL for the Settings page

### Known issues

If you see a 404 error on the main page, you might need to choose `Remix` as the Framework Preset for your project in settings.

## Local development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

Open up http://localhost:3000 and you should be ready to go!
