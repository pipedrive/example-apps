# Sample App for Pipedrive Marketplace

A very basic example of how to:

- Authorize with OAuth using [passportjs](http://www.passportjs.org/).
- Get all open deals from Pipedrive.
- Mark selected deal randomly as won or lost.

## Installation and usage for Glitch Apps

- In the `config.js` file, fill in the `clientID` and `clientSecret` values. You will obtain that once you create an App via the Marketplace Manager.
- Ensure that the app is running by checking the _Logs_ panel in the footer.
