This app lets you build a simple caller app using Twilio. The accompanying tutorial can be found [here](https://developers.pipedrive.com/tutorials/codelabs/building-cti-phone-solutions-pipedrive-app/index.htm?index=..%2F..index#0).


### What will we be doing?
- Extending the Pipedrive Boilerplate App
- Configuring vendor platform (Twilio) to use them in our app
- Adding API routes to authenticate with Twilio and handle voice calls
- Building a frontend using Bootstrap to dial and receive calls
